Hi there! I am a researcher passionate about exploring the synergies between `natural and machine intelligence` . 

In 2020, I earned my master's degree at Macau University of Science and Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. Hon-Cheng Wong](https://www.must.edu.mo/en/scse/staff/wonghoncheng). Subsequently, I worked as an Applied Researcher at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us) in the Feedback team (led by Sharon Zheng), where I contributed to improving the engineering efficiency of over hundreds of businesses. In 2018, I graduated from Beijing Normal University (Zhuhai) with a B. E. degree in Computer Science and Engineering, advised by Prof. Jing Huang.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of `Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive computing and Reinforcement Learning` . My goals are to (1) enhance the comprehension of natural intelligence by leveraging machine intelligence, (2) utilize insights from natural intelligence to advance machine intelligence technology, and (3) leverage these advancements to develop safer and more foresighted applications. For more details, you can refer to my [Research Statement](https://winny-shang.github.io/assets/pdf/Research Statement_Yunyi Shang.pdf)(Dec 2023). However, my research plan is not fixed in place, I am adaptable and open to exploring new and diverse opportunities.

:sparkles: **I am seeking a Ph. D. position in the 2024 cycle!** If you think I might be a fit, I’d love to hear from you.
