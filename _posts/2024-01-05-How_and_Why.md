> When describing "how," the focus is on reconstructing a series of events from one point leading to another. On the other hand, explaining "why" involves identifying causal relationships and understanding why a series of events occurred in a particular way rather than another. Explaining past events can be influenced by their outcomes, and interpreting why current results seem inevitable with hindsight can lead to biases.

#### **Distinguishing "How" and "Why":**

In language, "how" questions focus on specific steps and methods to achieve a goal or reach a certain state. For example, we might ask, "How to make a cup of coffee?" This question leads us to reconstruct a sequence of events and steps to achieve the goal of making coffee.

Conversely, "why" questions focus on the reasons or motives behind things happening. For instance, "Why does the sky turn dark?" This question delves into the fundamental reasons or factors leading to this phenomenon, involving explanations of cause and effect relationships.

#### **Application in Computer Modeling:**

In computer model training, models that focus on "how" are primarily concerned with implementing specific tasks or generating specific outputs. These models typically rely on large-scale pre-training on language data to learn language representations and patterns, tackling various natural language processing tasks such as text generation, question answering, and language understanding. While these models excel at modeling language data, they pay less attention to causal reasoning or explanations behind events.

On the other hand, "why" models, also known as causal inference models, possess the ability to understand causal relationships. These models specialize in revealing the root causes, motives, and influencing factors behind events, offering more interpretable results. In prediction, decision support, and adversarial contexts, these models have certain advantages, providing deeper insights and guidance.

#### **The Importance of "Why" in History:**

History often appears inevitable in hindsight, while seeming unclear or unpredictable at the time. Emphasizing the importance of "why" in historical analysis helps us understand the fundamental reasons, motives, and influencing factors behind events.

Analyzing historical events using "why" models can provide deeper insights, helping us better understand the development process of historical events and phenomena. By exploring the interactions between different factors, the motives behind decisions, and the background conditions of events, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of historical events.

#### **Importance in Computer Training:**

Current large-scale models (such as the GPT, BERT, etc.) tend to be "how" models, focusing on executing various natural language processing tasks. While these models excel at handling tasks, they still have limitations in terms of interpretability and reasoning ability.

In education, emphasizing the importance of understanding "why" is crucial. Educators often remind students that selecting an answer is not as important as understanding why that answer is chosen. Through understanding the reasons and logic behind problems, students can develop deeper knowledge and skills, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and creative thinking.

In computer training, enabling models to understand "why" is equally important. Simply training models to perform tasks or produce correct outputs is not enough. Understanding the reasons, motives, and logic behind tasks is essential for the model's robustness, generalization ability, and interpretability.

Through understanding the reasons and logic behind problems, models can better adapt to new situations and data, demonstrating stronger generalization ability and providing more interpretable decision processes.
